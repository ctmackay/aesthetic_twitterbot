Twitterbot @robotaesthetic1
This creative robot will generate a new exercise of the day “EotD” every 24 hours.
It works by scraping bodybuilding.com for every exercise available. 
It downloads all of the exercise descriptions as text, grouping them by muscle, title, and step number.
A Markov chain is built and new text can be generated.
The exercise description is overlaid over an image in order to bypass the 140 character limit, and also to look much cooler.
The status is tweeted, using the twitter API, and is repeated every 24 hours.
